# Deployment

The site is deployed as static files served by a Caddy container behind Traefik.

## Server setup

Server-side directory layout:

```
/home/hostroot/sites/danquah/sljob/
  docker-compose.yml
  Caddyfile
  htdocs/                # mounted into Caddy container as /srv
    index.html
    assets/
    logos/
    og-jobbank.jpg       # OG social sharing image
    jobs-export.json     # managed by cron (not touched by deploys)
    job/                 # OG pages generated by fetch script (not touched by deploys)
      bartender-470/
        index.html
      ...
    version.json         # written by deploy script
  scripts/               # fetch-job-export.py and config.json (not in htdocs)
```

Copy `docker-compose.yml` and `Caddyfile` to the server and start the container:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Updating the Caddyfile

`Caddyfile` is **not deployed by rsync** — it lives alongside `docker-compose.yml` on the server and must be updated manually when changed:

```bash
scp deploy/Caddyfile <user>@<host>:/home/hostroot/sites/danquah/sljob/Caddyfile
ssh <user>@<host> "cd /home/hostroot/sites/danquah/sljob && docker compose exec caddy caddy reload --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile"
# or if reload isn't available:
ssh <user>@<host> "cd /home/hostroot/sites/danquah/sljob && docker compose restart caddy"
```

## Automated deployment

Pushes to `main` trigger a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) that:

1. Builds the project
2. Writes `version.json` with the git SHA, tags, and timestamp
3. Rsyncs `dist/` to the server

The rsync excludes server-managed files that must not be overwritten:

| Excluded | Managed by |
|----------|------------|
| `jobs-export.json` | Cron job running `run-export.sh` |
| `job/` | Fetch script — OG pages generated alongside `jobs-export.json` |

### Required GitHub secrets

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY` | Private SSH key for the deploy user |
| `DEPLOY_HOST` | Server hostname |
| `DEPLOY_USER` | SSH username on the server |
| `DEPLOY_PATH` | Destination path on the server |

For the beta environment, the same secrets are used with a `_BETA` suffix: `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY_BETA`, `DEPLOY_HOST_BETA`, `DEPLOY_USER_BETA`, `DEPLOY_PATH_BETA`.

## Manual deployment

```bash
DEPLOY_HOST=example.com DEPLOY_USER=deploy DEPLOY_PATH=/path/to/htdocs/ bash deploy/deploy.sh
```

The script runs `npm ci && npm run build`, then rsyncs `dist/` to the server.

## OG social sharing pages

Per-job Open Graph HTML pages are generated by `scripts/fetch-job-export.py` and written to `htdocs/job/{slug}/index.html` alongside `jobs-export.json`. Caddy serves them when a social media crawler (or anyone) requests `/job/{slug}` — the page has the correct `og:title`, `og:description`, and `og:image` tags baked in. Real users get the same file, which loads the SPA normally.

**Requirements:**
- `htdocs/index.html` must exist (i.e. the site must have been deployed at least once) before the fetch script can generate OG pages.
- The Caddyfile uses `try_files {path} {path}/ /index.html` so Caddy checks for a matching directory before falling back to the SPA shell.

### Local OG page testing

```bash
# 1. Build the app
npm run build

# 2. Generate jobs-export.json + OG pages into dist/
OUTPUT_DIR=dist SITE_URL=http://localhost:5173 python3 scripts/fetch-job-export.py

# 3. Preview (serves dist/ — inspect dist/job/<slug>/index.html)
npm run preview -- --port 5173
```

## Version info

Each deploy writes a `version.json` to the site root:

```json
{"sha": "a832e2f...", "short_sha": "a832e2f", "tags": ["v1.0.0"], "deployed_at": "2026-02-15T21:50:00Z"}
```

Access it at `https://jobs.spejderneslejr.dk/version.json`.

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Caddyfile` | Caddy config — SPA fallback with directory index support for OG pages |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Caddy Alpine container with Traefik v1 labels |
| `deploy.sh` | Build & rsync deploy script (used locally and by CI) |
